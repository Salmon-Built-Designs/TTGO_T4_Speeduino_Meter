# TTGO_T4_Speeduino_Meter
 LCD meter for Speeduino data using TTGO T4 ESP32
 I will be adding documentation soon... for now, if you have questions email me at geoff.shorten@shortens.ca
 
 The display uses a Lilygo twatcher module (http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50033&Id=1160&FId=t3:50033:3 ).  This is an ESP32 based module with an integrated 320x240 pixel display, 6mb of ram and 4 buttons.  
 
 It gets Air fuel Ratio data and other info from the speeduino ECU via the secondary serial interface and displays it in real time on the tft display.  The code uses a library I made for getting the data, speeddata.
 
 I've uploaded photos of the gauge in the car ( a Lotus super 7 clone).
